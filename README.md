Concept project for Kid's Eye Safe Smart TV. Circuit built using microcontroller (ESP32) and ultrasonic distance censor (HC-SR04) will detect the distance of the nearest obstacle. If the measured distance is less than the preconfigured threshold (say 1 meter), microcontroller will call smart TV API to "Play/Pause".
